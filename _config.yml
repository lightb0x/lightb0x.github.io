  I'm CSE student/Ph.D candidate at [CMALab, Seoul National University](http://cmalab.snu.ac.kr/).

  My general topic of interest is **hardware-software co-design**.

  Specifically, from application down to hardware:
    - Applications
      - **Vision**, [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)
      - **LLM**, [LLaMA.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), [Mamba](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba) and [Jamba](https://huggingface.co/ai21labs/Jamba-v0.1)
    - **Quantization**
    - NN compiler
      - [OpenAI Triton](https://github.com/openai/triton)
    - RTL
      - [Amaranth](https://github.com/amaranth-lang/amaranth)

          From SNUCSE 2020 "creative integrated design" class.

          Trash classification on Arduino Nano 33 BLE and Raspberry Pi 2.

          From training various models(MbV1, MbV2, ShV2) on resized imagenet(96x96, 128x128, ...), fine-tuning on trashnet down to actually running on hardwares.

          This course covers hardware-software co-design in terms of building custom NN accelerator.

          Till 2022, the course covered: Xilinx FPGA (Zedboard) ~ verilog on Vivado ~ C++ ~ MNIST classification(caffe2).

          In 2023, I revised the course to be: Amaranth simulator ~ simple NN compiler ~ torch.
            * GEMM accelerator
              * simple instruction set
              * reconfigurable
              * outer product matrix-matrix multiplication
              * on Amaranth
            * simple NN compiler
              * generate simple instruction set code given input pytorch GEMM

          In cloud management group, objective of the team was to try out new technologies, especially Kubernetes and Terraform at that time.

          I tried toy project with React, golang-gin, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform.
